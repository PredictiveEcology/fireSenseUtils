\usage{
rasterFireBufferDT(
  years,
  fireRaster,
  flammableRTM,
  bufferForFireRaster,
  areaMultiplier,
  minSize = 5000,
  verb = 1,
  cores = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{numeric fire years}

\item{fireRaster}{a \code{SpatRaster} with values representing fire years}

\item{flammableRTM}{a \code{rasterToMatch} with binary values where 1 represents flammable pixels}

\item{bufferForFireRaster}{buffer size used to group discrete patches of burned pixels as
belonging to the same fire}

\item{areaMultiplier}{A scalar that will buffer \code{areaMultiplier * fireSize}}

\item{minSize}{The absolute minimum size of the buffer & non-buffer together. This will
be imposed after \code{areaMultiplier}.}

\item{verb}{Logical or numeric related to how much verbosity is printed. \code{FALSE} or
\code{0} is none. \code{TRUE} or \code{1} is some. \code{2} is much more.}

\item{cores}{number of processor cores to use}
}
\value{
a list of data.table named by year, with cols \code{ids}, \code{buffer},
and \code{pixelID}
}
