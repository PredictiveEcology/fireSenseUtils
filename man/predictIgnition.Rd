\usage{
predictIgnition(
  model,
  data,
  coefs,
  rescaleFactor,
  lambdaRescaleFactor,
  linkinv
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{formula of fitted model (\code{sim$fireSense_IgnitionFitted[["formula"]][-2]})}

\item{data}{data for prediction}

\item{coefs}{model coefficients (\code{sim$fireSense_IgnitionFitted$coef})}

\item{rescaleFactor}{spatial rescaling factor when predicted and fitted data are at different scales.
Calculaed as: (predResolution/fitResolution)^2}

\item{lambdaRescaleFactor}{If the data for fitting has been sampled for pseudo-absences,
this imposes a new baseline probability of fire occurrences, hence predictions need to be adjusted.
If the  original fire prob. is (total no. fires)/(total no. fires + total no. absences), and the fire
probability imposed by sampling is (total no. fires)/(total no. fires + no. sampled pseudo-absences), to
adjust predicted values, one needs to multiply them by (total no. fires + no. sampled pseudo-absences/(total no. fires + total no. absences)}

\item{linkinv}{family link function (\code{sim$fireSense_IgnitionFitted$family$linkinv})}
}
\value{
vector of predicted values.
