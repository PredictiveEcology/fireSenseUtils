\title{Convert a list of \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} object to a list of \code{data.table} objects}
\usage{
makeLociList(
  ras,
  pts,
  idsCol = "FIRE_ID",
  dateCol = "YEAR",
  sizeCol = "POLY_HA",
  sizeColUnits = "ha"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ras}{A raster that will be the template for cells (pixel ids)}

\item{pts}{A list of \code{sf} point objects}

\item{idsCol}{Character string identifying column name in \code{pts} that has unique
id per event (i.e., fire)}

\item{dateCol}{Character string identifying column name in \code{pts} that has year}

\item{sizeCol}{Character string identifying column name in \code{pts} that has size of
individual event. Can be in hectares or metres squared. Should set \code{sizeColUnits}}

\item{sizeColUnits}{Character string. Either \code{"ha"} or \code{"m2"}.}
}
\value{
A list of data.table objects, each with 4 columns, \code{"size"} (in pixels), \code{"date"},
\code{"ids"} from \code{idsCol}, and \code{"cells"}, which are the pixel indices of the
\code{pts} points.
}
\description{
Must supply a raster so that points can be converted to the cells on a raster.
It is assumed that the \code{sizeCol} is accurate.
If not, it should be recalculated before this function call.
