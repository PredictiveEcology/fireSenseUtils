\title{Generate, Summarize, Predict Burn Classes from Covariates}
\usage{
burnClassGenerator(df, numClasses = 4:9, AUC = TRUE, plotAUC = FALSE)

burnClassSummary(mod)

burnClassPredict(mod, df)

burnProbFromClass(mod, df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame (or data.table), with covarites, including "burned" (a binary 0, 1
notburned = 0, burned = 1), e.g., timeSinceFire, biomassJackPine, etc. that will
be used to find fuel classes. This set of covariates must be available both during
fitting and for prediction. These must be quantitative.}

\item{numClasses}{A vector indicating how many classes should be attempted. The function
will return the number of classes that best classify the data into homogeneous groups.}

\item{AUC}{Logical. Should the Area Under the receiver operating Curve be returned?}

\item{plotAUC}{Logical. Should the plot of the AUC be made.}

\item{mod}{A model of class \code{Mclust}, e.g,. coming from \code{Mclust} or
\code{burnClassGenerator}}
}
\value{
A list with 2 elements, first the \code{model}, which comes from \code{mclust::Mclust},
and second the Area Under the Curve or AUC as an indicator of the overal goodness of fit.

The basic solution is to take all covariates, including the binary "not burned", "burned"
(coded as 0 and 1, respectively), and do model-based clustering with the \code{mclust}
R package. We can choose a fixed number of burn classes, or a finite range (see
\code{numClasses} argument.
This will make \code{numClasses} "homogeneous" groups,
including whether they burned or not.
From this, we can identify groups by looking at the mean values of "burned" to see
what their burn tendency is as a "homogeneous" group.
