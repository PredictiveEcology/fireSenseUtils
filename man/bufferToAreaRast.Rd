\title{create a variable sized buffer around a set of pixels belonging to the same fire ID}
\usage{
bufferToAreaRast(fireIDraster, areaMultiplier, minSize, flammableRTM, verb = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{fireIDraster}{a \code{SpatRaster} with values representing distinct fires in a year}

\item{areaMultiplier}{A scalar that will buffer \code{areaMultiplier * fireSize}}

\item{minSize}{The absolute minimum size of the buffer & non-buffer together. This will
be imposed after \code{areaMultiplier}.}

\item{flammableRTM}{@template flammableRTM}

\item{verb}{Logical or numeric related to how much verbosity is printed. \code{FALSE} or
\code{0} is none. \code{TRUE} or \code{1} is some. \code{2} is much more.}
