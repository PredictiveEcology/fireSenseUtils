\item{n}{number of observations. If \code{length(n) > 1}, the length
    is taken to be the number required.}

\item{l}{scalar numeric for the lower bound}

\item{u}{scalar numeric for the upper bound}

\item{m}{scalar numeric for the mean}

\item{shape2}{If provided, passed to \code{rbeta}. If not, \code{m} must be (i.e., the mean)}
