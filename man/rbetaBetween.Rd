\title{Generate random beta variates between 2 values and a mean}
\usage{
rbetaBetween(n, l, u, m, shape1, shape2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of observations. If \code{length(n) > 1}, the length
    is taken to be the number required.}

\item{l}{scalar numeric for the lower bound}

\item{u}{scalar numeric for the upper bound}

\item{m}{scalar numeric for the mean}

\item{shape1}{non-negative parameters of the Beta distribution.}

\item{shape2}{If provided, passed to \code{rbeta}. If not, \code{m} must be (i.e., the mean)}
}
