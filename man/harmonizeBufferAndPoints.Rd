\usage{
harmonizeBufferAndPoints(cent, buff, ras, idCol = "FIRE_ID")
}
\arguments{
\item{cent}{List of points as \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame}}

\item{buff}{List of \code{data.table} objects with 3 columns, "buffer" which is 1 (in the fire)
or 0 (in a buffer), \code{ids} which are the fire ids which MUST match the ids
in the \code{cent}.}

\item{ras}{The raster that created the \code{pixelIDs} in the \code{buff}.}

\item{idCol}{The column name as a character string with the fire ids.
Defaults to \code{"FIRE_ID"}.}
}
\description{
Mostly this is about 2 things:
\enumerate{
\item remove fires that were so small that they take less than 1 pixel so they are
not in the \code{buff} object but are in the \code{cent} object.
\item the centroid cell is in a buffer or otherwise nonburnable cell (e.g., water).
For 1) remove these from the centroid data.
For 2) this function will search in the neighbourhood for the next closest pixel
that has at least 7 available neighbours that can burn. If not, remove these.
